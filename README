A quick-n-dirty perl script to parse iTunes Connect's application tranasction logs, and display them in a "pretty" way.

Provide the script with any number of files to parse via the command line, and it will generate an HTML document in the current directory
with statistics gleaned from the provided files.

So, for example, let's say I have a directory called ~/AppLogs/, which contains many text files that are each one daily log file as downloaded
from iTunes Connect's "Sales/Trend Reports" pane. Here is how I would run the script (assuming the script is kept at ~/parseAppTransactionLogs.pl):

$ ~/parseAppTransactionLogs.pl ~/AppLogs/*.txt

If everything went correctly, the script will print to STDOUT which files it has processed, and will produce an HTML file named "Day-XX-YEAR.html",
where "Day" is the three-letter weekday, "XX" is the day of the month, and "YEAR" is, well, the year.
