A quick-n-dirty perl script to parse iTunes Connect's application tranasction
daily logs, and display them in a "pretty" way. (Weekly logs work, but don't
result in very good looking output).

Provide the script with any number of files to parse via the command line, 
and it will generate an HTML document in the current directory with statistics
gleaned from the provided files.

So, for example, let's say I have a directory called ~/AppLogs/, which contains
any number of text files that are each one daily log file as downloaded from 
iTunes Connect's "Sales/Trend Reports" pane. Here is how I would run the script
(assuming the script is kept at ~/parseAppTransactionLogs.pl):

$ ~/parseAppTransactionLogs.pl ~/AppLogs/*.txt

If everything went correctly, the script will print to STDOUT which files it has
processed, and will produce an HTML file named "Day-XX-YEAR.html", where "Day" 
is the three-letter weekday, "XX" is the day of the month, and "YEAR" is, well,
the year.

Enjoy! And bug dev@null.com for support. Seriously, I don't want to hear it.
